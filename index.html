            <h1>Jimmy Donaldson</h1>
            <p>
              Jimmy Donaldson (born May 7, 1998), better known as MrBeast, is an
              American YouTube personality credited with pioneering a genre of
              YouTube videos that centers on expensive stunts. His main YouTube
              channel, "MrBeast", is the fifth-most-subscribed on the platform.
              Donaldson began posting videos to YouTube in early 2012 at the age
              of 13, under the handle "MrBeast6000"; his early content ranged
              from Let's Plays to "videos estimating the wealth of other
              YouTubers." He went viral in 2017 after his "counting to 100,000"
              video earned tens of thousands of views in just a few days, and he
              has become increasingly popular ever since, with most of his
              videos gaining tens of millions of views.

          <h2 class="career__title">Early viral attempts (2012–2017)</h2>
          <p>
            Donaldson uploaded his first YouTube video in February 2012, at the
            age of 13, under the handle "MrBeast6000"; his early content ranged
            from Let's Plays (mainly focused on Minecraft and Call of Duty:
            Black Ops 2), videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers,
            videos that offered tips to upcoming YouTube creators, and
            commentary on YouTube drama. Donaldson appeared only infrequently in
            these videos. In July 2013, the subscriber count of his channel,
            then named "That-dude", was around 240. In 2015 and 2016, Donaldson
            began to gain popularity with his "worst intros" series poking fun
            at YouTube video introductions. By mid-2016, Donaldson had around
            30,000 subscribers.

          <h2>Rise to fame (2017–2020)</h2>
          <p>
            In January 2017, Donaldson published an almost day-long video of
            himself counting to 100,000. The stunt took him 40 hours, with some
            parts sped up to "keep it under 24 hours." Donaldson also gained
            popularity during this period with stunts, such as attempting to
            break glass using a hundred megaphones, watching paint dry for an
            hour, attempting to stay underwater for 24 hours (which ended up
            failing due to health issues), and an unsuccessful attempt to spin a
            fidget spinner for a day. By 2018, Donaldson had given out $1
            million through his outlandish stunts, which earned him the title of
            "YouTube's biggest philanthropist."

          <h2>Profitability (2021–present)</h2>
          <p>
            In November 2021, Donaldson uploaded a recreation of the survival
            drama streaming television series Squid Game in real life, in which
            456 people competed for a $456,000 cash prize, without the violence
            in the show. The video has more than 297 million views as of
            November 1, 2022, making it Donaldson's most-viewed YouTube video
            and also making it one of the most-watched YouTube videos of 2021. A
            review of the video in Vice stated that it "badly misunderstood the
            anti-capitalist message of Squid Game".
